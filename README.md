Quick description:
The webservice is developed in node.js, using the express routing framework.

The idea of the webservice is to present and modify (later) schedules for students. 
A student will be able to access his/her schedule and see what team they are assigned to.
A team will have a schedule that shows the subjects in the requested week.
